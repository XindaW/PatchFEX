# PatchFEX

Feature extraction (FEX) for security patch clearance through Nearest Link Search in the paper [PatchDB: A Large-Scale Security Patch Dataset](https://csis.gmu.edu/ksun/publications/dsn21_PatchDB.pdf).

Also, an advanced solution of feature extraction for security patch identification in the paper [Detecting "0-Day" Vulnerability: An Empirical Study of Secret Security Patch in OSS](https://csis.gmu.edu/ksun/publications/secretpatch-dsn19.pdf).
